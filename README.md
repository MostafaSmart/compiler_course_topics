# compiler_course_topics
This repository contains a collection of projects related to compiler design, implemented in C# using ANTLR. Each week, a new project will be added, covering various topics and concepts in compiler theory. These projects are part of a course on compiler design and demonstrate practical implementations of lexical analysis, parsing, syntax trees, and more.
